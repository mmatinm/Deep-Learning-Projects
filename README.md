# Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains different deep learning projects I have worked on.  
Each folder inside this repo is a standalone project with its own README file, code, models, and results.

## Projects

### 1. [System Identification and Control Using RNNs](./System%20Identification%20and%20Control%20Using%20RNNs)
Simulate a mass-spring-damper system and build a simple RNN model to learn and control it.  
Covers system identification, classical control, and neural-network-based control.

- Techniques: SimpleRNN, LSTM, supervised learning
- Libraries: TensorFlow, Keras, Control Systems, SciPy
