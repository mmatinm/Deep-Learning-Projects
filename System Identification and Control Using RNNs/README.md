Description

This repo is split into two main parts:

System IdentificationTrain a SimpleRNN model to predict how the system moves (position) when you push on it.

ControlUse that model to build a controller that drives the system toward a target position.

The dynamic system is a mass connected to a spring and damper, driven by different input signals (square, sawtooth, sine).

Features

Generate and visualize system responses to square, sawtooth, and sine wave inputs.

Train a SimpleRNN to learn the plant (mass-spring-damper) behavior.

Build a classic P controller and a neural-network-based controller.

End-to-end training of controller + plant in one model.

Save and load trained models for reuse.

Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher

numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scipy, scikit-learn

tensorflow, keras

control

Install all with:

pip install control numpy pandas matplotlib scipy scikit-learn tensorflow keras

Installation

## Usage

### 1. Identify the system (plant)

```bash
python "System Identification.py"

Uncomment the plotting section in that script if you want to see the training/validation curves.

2. Control the system

Make sure the paths to trained_SRNN_model.keras, ctrlxplantfinal.keras, and ctrl_final.keras in Control.py point to your model files.

Run:

python "Control.py"

Youâ€™ll get plots of how well the controller keeps the mass at the setpoint, plus error metrics (IAE, ISE, RMSE).

Results

Below are the key plots illustrating system identification and control performance.Make sure you generate and save these images into the /images folder and name them exactly as below.
